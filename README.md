# rDNAse

Comprehensive toolkit for generating various numerical representation schemes of DNA sequence. The descriptors included in the rDNAse
package are extensively utilized in bioinformatics and chemogenomics.

## Package Description

### Commonly used descriptors

  * Nucleic acid composition
    * Basic kmer
    * Reverse compliment kmer
    * Increment of diversity 

  * Autocorrelation
    * Dinucleotide-based auto covariance
    * Dinucleotide-based cross covariance
    * Dinucleotide-based auto-cross covariance
    * Trinucleotide-based auto covariance
    * Trinucleotide-based cross covariance
    * Trinucleotide-based auto-cross covariance
  
 * Nucleic acid composition
    * Pseudo dinucleotide composition
    * Pseudo k-tupler nucleotide composition
    
    ### Similarity Computation

Local and global pairwise sequence alignment for DNA sequences:

  * Between two DNA sequences
  * Parallelized pairwise similarity calculation with a list of DNA sequences

GO semantic similarity measures:

  * Between two groups of GO terms / two Entrez Gene IDs
  * Parallelized pairwise similarity calculation with a list of GO terms / Entrez Gene IDs
